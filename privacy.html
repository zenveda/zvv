    <p>
      In accordance with industry standards and compliance frameworks, we collect proof of consent from all users and consumers before initiating any marketing or transactional communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      This proof of consent may take the form of:
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
        <li>A URL link to a webpage where consent is explicitly provided by the consumer</li>
        <li>A hosted image file demonstrating opt-in consent via screenshot</li>
        <li>A hosted document outlining the context and method of the opt-in event</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      We support the submission of multiple URLs that collectively demonstrate the story of the opt-in. All URLs must be publicly accessible, resolvable, and compliant with platform policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our agency maintains a secure, timestamped audit trail for each consent record. These records can be made available to relevant authorities or platforms upon request to ensure full compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      By engaging with Project Origins, you acknowledge and agree that any messaging communications we initiate will only occur upon lawful and recorded consent.
